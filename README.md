This script is designed to only work with configuration files from my internship... 

This script parses specified configuration files, extracting desired information and outputting it to Excel sheets. Users can input multiple configuration files and parse them for specific information. Additionally, the script performs calculations on columns and appends the results to the Excel sheet.
